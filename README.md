2. Beginners can just click "edit", make changes to the text, and click "commit changes" at the bottom of the page.
3. Non-beginners can just send a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
4. Finally, `ideas.md` is written using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

If you're interested in who came up with a certain idea (or who edited your own idea), click ["blame"](https://github.com/dclegalhackers/ideas/blame/master/ideas.md) on the `ideas.md` page. It's great introduction to appreciating the features of Git and GitHub.

To view a log of changes to this repository, click on ["commits"](https://github.com/dclegalhackers/ideas/commits/master). When you click on a commit, you can see which changes were made, line-by-line. This is called a "diff".

To view a list of proposed changes, click on the ["Pull Requests"](https://github.com/dclegalhackers/ideas/pulls) icon (it's on the right side of the page).

If you have a question about anything here, click on the ["Issues"](https://github.com/dclegalhackers/ideas/issues) icon (also on the right side of the page). It's good etiquette to browse through the Issues before you post your own--someone else may have already solved your problem!
