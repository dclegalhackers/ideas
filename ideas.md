##IDEAS: 

###International
* Fix Legal Search - make searching discovery documents as easy as googling
* Court rules in markdown/low-cost apps
* Citation Checker (compare quoted language to pin cited page using Google Scholar or other site)
* Data Licensing Navigator 
* Modeling corporate networks, beneficial ownership, merger & acquisition processes; OpenCorporates contacts could help

###National
* Improve data model of Legal Services Organizations so that people can search for nearby legal help by address and zip code
* First state-level, open-source, UELMA-compliant code of laws. 
* Updated: Same-sex Marriage Advisor
* Marijuana Regulation Advisor (by state) 
* Matching legal services/options for migrant children at the border (ideally via SMS or video); ACLU contacts could help 
* Drafting legal intake forms for technology services like Open Referral or Frontline SMS

###Federal

####Executive
* Improving agency comment filing and document databases through enhanced searching and contextual analysis.

####Legislative 
* Curating committee and subcommittee data to create automatic alerts (without a paid service)
* Programmatically measuring the freshness of Congressional Research Service reports 
* Congress analytics: programmatically identifying the number of identical bills per Congress, and bills that are identical to previous Congresses
* Parsing pre-introduced legislative PDFs (in various jurisdictions) to plaintext (with no line numbers, headers, or footers)
* For greater transparency: parsing the senate statement of expenditures to extract a staff list

###Local

####General
* Disability Eligibility Calculator --  It's hard for those receiving disability to understand how much they're allowed to earn and what their options might be if they go over the threshold. In particular, the "wage subsidy" remedy available seems to require employer participation but there's basically no information online about how to pursue it. A combination of a calculator (since thresholds vary by area, IIRC) and guidance could go a long way.
* Employment Navigator -- Non-disclosure & Non-compete agreements Guides, what an employer may require of an employee (hours, etc.), how an employee can legally be terminated, and what leave an employee is entitled to (such as FMLA); hiring discrimination.
* Household contract advisor: for babysitter/nanny, lawn mower, home contractors & local permitting
* Traffic Violation Advisor
* Tenant Rights Advisor  

####DC
* DC Small Claims Court Guides

####From DC City Council  
* Motions and Amendments. Over the last few months, I’ve been posting data of “contested” motions offered at the Council. I’ve put together a funky website showing how it might be used.  http://vzvenyach.github.io/Council_Motions/ to show the minimum, but there’s a lot of great data on the backend.
* Data modeling. It would be a neat effort to put together a comprehensive data model for the DC legal framework. A good place to start would be to work on the DC Register and the DC Municipal Regulations. There’s been almost no effort to build a structured data model for this critical regulatory framework…
